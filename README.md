# Flask Chatbox

A simple flask application that provides an UI for chat and handles the model internally.

Download the repo, type 'python app.py' from your current working directory

After chatbot trains, access the app on 127.0.0.1:5000 from your browser.

Use time.sleep() for delaying the chatbot response to make it  look more realistic.
